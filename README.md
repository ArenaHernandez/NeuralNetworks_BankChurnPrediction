# Neural Networks Bank Churn Prediction
## Problem Statement
### Context
In today's competitive banking landscape, customer churn has become a pressing concern for banks. With the rise of fintech startups and alternative banking options, customers have more choices than ever before. As a result, banks must proactively identify and address potential churn risks to maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty. By leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, banks can gain insights into customer behavior and preferences, enabling them to tailor their services and offerings to meet evolving needs.

## Objective
The main goal is to leverage neural network-based classification algorithms to develop a predictive model that can effectively determine the likelihood of customer churn. By analyzing various aspects of the banking service, including customer demographics, transaction history, and engagement metrics, the model aims to identify key factors influencing churn behavior. This understanding will enable management to prioritize efforts towards enhancing service quality, addressing customer concerns, and implementing retention initiatives tailored to specific customer segments. Ultimately, the predictive model will serve as a valuable tool for the bank to mitigate churn, optimize customer retention strategies, and foster long-term relationships with its clientele.

As a data scientist within the bank, the objective is to develop a neural network-based classifier to predict whether a customer will leave the bank within the next six months.
